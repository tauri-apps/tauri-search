Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.\n\nThe user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS and Windows, and [`gtk`](https://gtk-rs.org/docs/gtk/) on Linux via the **Tauri-team** incubated and maintained [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), which creates a unified interface to the system webview (and other goodies like Menu and Taskbar), leveraging WebKit on macOS, WebView2 on Windows and WebKitGTK on Linux.\n\nTo learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.\n\n## Get Started\nIf you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.studio). This README is directed towards those who are interested in contributing to the core library. But if you just want a quick overview about where `tauri` is at in its development, here's a quick burndown:\n\n### Platforms\n- [x] Windows 7,8,10\n- [x] Linux\n- [x] macOS\n- [ ] iOS (in progress)\n- [ ] android (soon)\n\n### App Bundles\n- [x] App Icons\n- [x] Build on MacOS (.app, .dmg)\n- [x] Build on Linux (.deb, AppImage)\n- [x] Build on Windows (.exe, .msi)\n- [x] Copy Buffer\n- [x] Device Notifications (toast)\n- [x] Self Updater\n- [x] App Signing\n- [x] Frameless Mode\n- [x] Transparent Mode\n- [x] Multiwindow Mode\n- [x] Tray\n- [ ] deeplink RPC (in progress)\n- [ ] One-Time commands (coming soon)\n\n### Security Features\n- [x] localhost-free (:fire:)\n- [x] custom protocol for secure mode\n- [x] Dynamic ahead of Time Compilation (dAoT) with functional tree-shaking\n- [x] functional Address Space Layout Randomization\n- [x] OTP salting of function names and messages at runtime\n- [x] CSP Injection\n\n### Utilities\n- [x] GH Action for creating binaries for all platforms\n- [x] VS Code Extension\n- [x] Tauri Core Plugins\n- [x] Update core dependencies automatically from the command line\n- [x] Rust-based CLI\n\n### Comparison between Tauri and Electron\n\n| Detail                     | Tauri  | Electron             |\n| -------------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |\n| Installer Size Linux       | 3.1 MB | 52.1 MB              |\n| Memory Consumption Linux   | 180 MB | 462 MB               |\n| Launch Time Linux          | 0.39s  | 0.80s                |\n| Interface Service Provider | WRY    | Chromium             |\n| Backend Binding            | Rust   | Node.js (ECMAScript) |\n| Underlying Engine          | Rust   | V8 (C/C++)           |\n| FLOSS                      | Yes    | No                   |\n| Multithreading             | Yes    | Yes                  |\n| Bytecode Delivery          | Yes    | No                   |\n| Multiple Windows           | Yes    | Yes                  |\n| Auto Updater               | Yes    | Yes<sup>1</sup>      |\n| Custom App Icon            | Yes    | Yes                  |\n| Windows Binary             | Yes    | Yes                  |\n| MacOS Binary               | Yes    | Yes                  |\n| Linux Binary               | Yes    | Yes                  |\n| iOS Binary                 | Soon   | No                   |\n| Android Binary             | Soon   | No                   |\n| Desktop Tray               | Yes    | Yes                  |\n| Sidecar Binaries           | Yes    | No                   |\n\n#### Notes\n1. Electron has no native auto updater on Linux, but is offered by electron-packager\n\n## Development\n\nTauri is a system composed of a number of moving pieces:\n\n### Infrastructure\n- Git for code management\n- GitHub for project management\n- GitHub actions for CI and CD\n- Discord for discussions\n- Netlify-hosted documentation website\n- DigitalOcean meilisearch instance\n\n### Major Runtimes\n- Node.js for running the CLI (deno and pure rust are on the roadmap)\n- Cargo for testing, running the dev service, building binaries and as the runtime harness for the webview\n\n### Major Languages\n- Rust for the CLI\n- EcmaScript bindings to the Rust API, written in typescript\n- Rust for bindings, rust side of the API, harnesses\n- Rust plugins to Tauri backend\n\n### Operating systems\nTauri core can be developed on Mac, Linux and Windows, but you are encouraged to use the latest possible operating systems and build tools for your OS.\n\n### Contributing\nBefore you start working on something, it's best to check if there is an existing issue first. It's also is a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone is already working on it.\n\nPlease make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.\n\nThank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!\n\n### Documentation\nDocumentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation of Rust code and at JSDoc in typescript / javascript code. We autocollect these and publish them using Docusaurus v2 and netlify. Here is the hosting repository for the documentation site: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs\n\n### Testing & Linting\nTest all the things! We have a number of test suites, but are always looking to improve our coverage:\n- Rust (`cargo test`) => sourced via inline `#[cfg(test)]` declarations\n- TS (`jest`) => via spec files\n- Smoke Tests (run on merges to latest)\n- eslint, clippy\n\n### CI/CD\nWe recommend you read this article to understand better how we run our pipelines: https://www.jacobbolda.com/setting-up-ci-and-cd-for-tauri/\n\n## Organization\nTauri aims to be a sustainable collective based on principles that guide [sustainable free and open software communities](https://sfosc.org).

It also re-exports [tao] as a module for event loop and window creation.\n\n[tao]: https://crates.io/crates/tao\n\n## Usage\n\nThe minimum example to create a Window and browse a website looks like following:\n\n```rust\nfn main() -> wry::Result<()> {\n  use wry::{\n    application::{\n      event::{Event, StartCause, WindowEvent},\n      event_loop::{ControlFlow, EventLoop},\n      window::WindowBuilder,\n    },\n    webview::WebViewBuilder,\n  };\n\n  let event_loop = EventLoop::new();\n  let window = WindowBuilder::new()\n    .with_title(\"Hello World\")\n    .build(&event_loop)?;\n  let _webview = WebViewBuilder::new(window)?\n    .with_url(\"https://tauri.studio\")?\n    .build()?;\n\n  event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {\n    *control_flow = ControlFlow::Wait;\n\n    match event {\n      Event::NewEvents(StartCause::Init) => println!(\"Wry has started!\"),\n      Event::WindowEvent {\n        event: WindowEvent::CloseRequested,\n        ..\n      } => *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit,\n      _ => (),\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThere are also more samples under `examples`, you can enter commands like the following to try them:\n\n```\ncargo run --example multi_window\n```\n\nFor more information, please read the documentation below.\n\n## [Documentation](https://docs.rs/wry)\n\n## Platform-specific notes\n\nAll platforms use [tao](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao) to build the window, and wry re-exports it as an application module. Here is the underlying web engine each platform uses, and some dependencies you might need to install.\n\n### Linux\n\nTao uses [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/) and its related libraries for window creation and wry also needs [WebKitGTK](https://webkitgtk.org/) for WebView. So please make sure the following packages are installed:\n\n#### Arch Linux / Manjaro:\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S webkit2gtk\nsudo pacman -S libappindicator-gtk3 # not required\n```\n\nThe `libayatana-indicator` package can be installed from the Arch User Repository (AUR).\n\n#### Debian / Ubuntu:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev\nsudo apt install libappindicator3-dev # not required\n```\n\n#### Fedora\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf install gtk3-devel webkit2gtk3-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel\n```\n\nFedora does not have the Ayatana package yet, so you need to use the GTK one, see the [feature flags documentation](https://docs.rs/wry/latest/wry/#feature-flags).\n\n### macOS\n\nWebKit is native on macOS so everything should be fine.\n\nIf you are cross-compiling for macOS using [osxcross](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross) and encounter a runtime panic like `Class with name WKWebViewConfiguration could not be found` it's possible that `WebKit.framework` has not been linked correctly, to fix this set the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable:\n\n```\nRUSTFLAGS=\"-l framework=WebKit\" cargo build --target=x86_64-apple-darwin --release\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nWebView2 provided by Microsoft Edge Chromium is used. So wry supports Windows 7, 8, and 10.\n\n### Android / iOS\n\nWe have experimental support of mobile ends. If you are interested in playing or hacking it, please follow this [note](https://hackmd.io/XIcEwk4GSxy8APZhSa0UnA?view).\n\n## License\nApache-2.0/MIT\n","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry"},{"id":"github_tauri_apps_tao","name":"tao","description":"The TAO of cross-platform windowing.

Built for you, maintained for Tauri.\n\n### Cargo Features\n\nTao provides the following features, which can be enabled in your `Cargo.toml` file:\n* `serde`: Enables serialization/deserialization of certain types with [Serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde).\n* `tray`: Enables system tray and more menu item variants on **Linux**. This flag is enabled by default.\n  You can still create those types if you disable it. They just don't create the actual objects. We set this flag because some implementations require more installed packages.\n* `ayatana-tray`: Enable this if you wish to use more update `libayatana-appindicator` since `libappindicator` is no longer maintained.\n  This flag is enabled by default. Disable this if you don't want to install the `libayatana-appindicator` package.\n* `gtk-tray`: Enable this if you wish ot use `libappindicator` for tray on **Linux**. The package is supported on more Linux distributions, but it is not maintained anymore.\n  Note that `ayatana-tray` and `gtk-tray` cannot be enabled at the same time, so `default-features` must be set to `false`.\n\n## Platform-specific notes\n\n### Android\n\nThis library makes use of the [ndk-rs](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs) crates, refer to that repo for more documentation.\n\nRunning on an Android device needs a dynamic system library, add this to Cargo.toml:\n```toml\n[[example]]\nname = \"request_redraw_threaded\"\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n```\n\nAnd add this to the example file to add the native activity glue:\n\n```rust\n#[cfg_attr(target_os = \"android\", ndk_glue::main(backtrace = \"on\"))]\nfn main() {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the application with `cargo apk run --example request_redraw_threaded`\n\n### Linux\n\nGtk and its related libraries are used to build the support of Linux. Be sure to install following packages before building:\n\n#### Arch Linux / Manjaro:\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S gtk3 libappindicator-gtk3\n```\n\n#### Debian / Ubuntu:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libappindicator3-dev\n```\n\n#### MacOS\n\nTo ensure compatibility with older MacOS systems, tao links to\nCGDisplayCreateUUIDFromDisplayID through the CoreGraphics framework.\nHowever, under certain setups this function is only available to be linked\nthrough the newer ColorSync framework. So, tao provides the\n`TAO_LINK_COLORSYNC` environment variable which can be set to `1` or `true`\nwhile compiling to enable linking via ColorSync.\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThis is a fork of [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) which replaces Linux's port to Gtk.\nWe need it not only because webkit2gtk, but also a lot Desktop Environment features like menu bar, system tray, global shortcuts etc.\nIn the future, we want to make these features more modular as separate crates. So we could switch back to winit and also benefit whole community.\n","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao"},{"id":"github_tauri_apps_tauri_action","name":"tauri-action","description":"Build your Web application as a Tauri binary for MacOS, Linux and Windows","kind":"unknown","stars":156,"watchers":156,"subscribers":10,"openIssues":27,"forks":27,"defaultBranch":"dev","language":"TypeScript","topics":["github-actions","hacktoberfest"],"isTemplate":false,"lastUpdated":"2022-05-08T05:18:22Z","createdAt":"2020-07-07T21:41:23Z","license":"MIT License","text":"# Tauri GitHub Action\n\nThis GitHub Action builds your Web application as a Tauri native binary for MacOS, Linux and Windows.\nIf your project doesn't include the Tauri files, we create it at compile time, so if you don't need to use Tauri's API, you can just ship native apps through this Action.\n\n# Usage\n\nThis GitHub Action has three main usages: test the build pipeline of your Tauri app, uploading Tauri artifacts to an existing release, and creating a new release with the Tauri artifacts.\n\n## Testing the Build\n\n```yml\nname: \"test-on-pr\"\non: [pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  test-tauri:\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]\n\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}\n    steps:\n    -

We automatically initialize Tauri before building, and configure it to use your Web artifacts.\n  - You can configure Tauri with the `configPath`, `distPath` and `iconPath` options.\n- You can run custom Tauri CLI scripts with the `tauriScript` option. So instead of running `yarn tauri build` or `npx tauri build`, we'll execute `${tauriScript}`.\n  - Useful when you need custom build functionality when creating Tauri apps e.g. a `desktop:build` script.\n- When your app isn't on the root of the repo, use the `projectPath` input.\n","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action"},{"id":"github_tauri_apps_tauri_docs","name":"tauri-docs","description":"The source for all tauri project documentation.","kind":"documentation","stars":332,"watchers":332,"subscribers":19,"openIssues":65,"forks":131,"defaultBranch":"dev","language":"JavaScript","topics":["documentation","hacktoberfest","tauri"],"isTemplate":false,"lastUpdated":"2022-05-09T06:43:31Z","createdAt":"2020-03-09T00:22:43Z","license":"MIT License","text":"# Tauri Docs\n\nThis website is built using [Docusaurus 2] with [MeiliSearch] for the docs indexation and is deployed by Netlify.\n\n[![Deploys By Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/global/badges/netlify-light.svg)](https://www.netlify.com)\n\nIf you seek to change something from **our guides**, please refer to [the docs folder]. \\\nWhen browsing the website, you will find edit links at the bottom of these docs.\n\nThe **API docs** are generated from our [Rust] and [TypeScript] source code.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing Guide].\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 Tauri Programme within The Commons Conservancy\n\n[Docusaurus 2]: https://v2.docusaurus.io/\n[MeiliSearch]: https://github.com/meilisearch/\n[the docs folder]: ./docs\n[TypeScript]: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/tooling/api\n[Rust]: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/core/tauri\n[Contributing Guide]: ./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs"},{"id":"github_tauri_apps_tauri_vscode","name":"tauri-vscode","description":"Visual Studio Code Extension for Tauri apps development","kind":"unknown","stars":120,"watchers":120,"subscribers":9,"openIssues":10,"forks":4,"defaultBranch":"dev","language":"TypeScript","topics":[],"isTemplate":false,"lastUpdated":"2022-05-09T07:43:18Z","createdAt":"2020-07-06T16:20:49Z","text":"# Tauri VS Code Extension\n\nVisual Studio Code Extension that adds support to Tauri commands and `tauri.conf.json` JSON validation.\n\n## Supported commands\n\nIt adds the `init`, `deps`, `dev` and `build` commands to the `Command Palette`.\n\n## JSON validation\n\nThe extension automatically pulls the [latest config schema](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/tooling/cli/schema.json) so VS Code can display documentation and autocomplete.\n\n# Contributing\n\nFollowing [the official guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension), run `yarn` to install dependencies, `yarn compile` to build your changes and press `F5` to open a new `Extension Development Host` window.\n","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-vscode"},{"id":"github_tauri_apps_tauri_plugin_upload","name":"tauri-plugin-upload","description":"Tauri plugin for file uploads through HTTP","kind":"plugin","stars":4,"watchers":4,"subscribers":7,"openIssues":11,"forks":1,"defaultBranch":"dev","language":"Rust","topics":["tauri-plugin"],"isTemplate":false,"lastUpdated":"2022-04-30T20:03:07Z","createdAt":"2021-10-01T16:11:09Z","license":"Other","text":"# Tauri Plugin Upload\n![Test](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-upload/workflows/Test/badge.svg)\n\nThis plugin provides an interface for file uploads.\n\n## Architecture\nThis repo shape might appear to be strange, but it is really just a hybrid Rust / Typescript project that recommends a specific type of consumption, namely using GIT as the secure distribution mechanism, and referencing specific unforgeable git hashes.

It is written and tested in typescript, and ships with commonjs and an ejs versions - as well as all of its own typings in case you are using typescript.\n\nIf you don't know how localForage works, you would do well to check out those docs - because that is the underlying engine that this library uses. But for a refresher, localForage uses IndexedDB, WebSQL, or localStorage - depending on the best engine that the browser offers.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with your package manager\n```\nyarn add @tauri-apps/tauri-forage\n```\n\nImport into your JS / TS\n```\nimport { forage } from '@tauri-apps/tauri-forage'\n```\n\nUse it:\n```\nforage.setItem({\n  key: 'yourKey',\n  value: 'a value'\n})()\n```\n\n## How does it work?\nHere is the `getItem` function. There is a lot to discuss, and once you've understood the principle all of the other functions will make sense to you. If you want to see more details, check out the tests in `test/__tests__/tauriForage.spec.ts`\n\n```ts\ngetItem ({ key, logger, returner, before, store }: BeforeItem = {}) {\n  return async function (curry?: MaybeFunction) {\n    const storage = await _defineStore({ store: store })\n    key = before ? await handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(key) : key\n    return handler.returner(\n      storage.getItem(key).then(async (v: any) => {\n        return !before ? handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(v) : v\n      }).catch((err: any) => {\n        /* istanbul ignore next */\n        return handler.logger(err, logger)\n      })\n    )(returner)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn its most simple incarnation, you can just get the keyValue of the keyName.\n```\n```\n\n### Returner\nYou can instruct every function to return the value in specific ways.\n\n#### TYPES\n- 1(quiet) - return void 0\n- 2(console) - log the returned value to the console\n- 3(break) - throw an error with the contents of the return\n- 4(truthy) - return a true or false value\n- 5(typeof) - return type of response\n- 6(trace) - get a console.trace() of the call stack\n- 7(passthrough) - the default does nothing to the return\n\n\n### Logger\nIf an error occurs, you can determine how to respond:\n\n#### TYPES\n- 1(none) - just return\n- 2(string) - returned the string value of the error\n- 3(trace) - try to return a stack trace up to the error\n- 4(console) - write a console.error\n- 5(throw) - throw the error\n- 6(default) - return undefined\n\n> If you want, you can also use these handler functions yourself! They are properly exported and typed!\n\n### Currying\nHowever you can also curry the returned value with a function you can pass into the function call.\n\nLet's look at a few tests to see how currying can be applied:\n```ts\nit('will curry after', async () => {\n\n  await forage.setItem({\n    key: 'user',\n    value: { name: 'Alice' }\n  } as any)()\n\n  const curry = (v: any) => v.toUpperCase()\n\n  const user = await forage.getKeyValue({\n    key: 'user',\n    value: 'name'\n  } as any)(curry)\n\n  expect(user).toStrictEqual('ALICE')\n})\n```\n\nYou can also curry the value BEFORE it is used by localForage. This example is obviously quite trivial, but you may start to see a pattern emerge.\n```ts\n  it('will curry before', async () => {\n\n    // you can set objects or arrays or even huge base64 strings for values\n    await forage.setItem({\n      key: 'user',\n      value: {\n        name: 'Alice'\n      }\n    }  as any)()\n\n    const curry = (v: any) => v.toLowerCase()\n\n    const user = await forage.getKeyValue({\n      key: 'user',\n      value: 'NAME',\n      before: true\n    } as any)(curry)\n\n    expect(user).toStrictEqual('Alice')\n  })\n```\n\nIf you want to have multiple \"stores\", you can easily do that too.\n\n\n## Extensions to localForage\nOf note are the extensions to the generic interface:\n - mergeItem (with a number of merge strategies available)\n - getKeyValue\n - deleteItemKey\n - hasKey\n - hasKeyValue\n\n## undefined / void 0 => always returns null!\n> Even if undefined is saved, null will be returned by getItem().\nThis is due to a limitation in localStorage, and for compatibility\nreasons localForage cannot store the value undefined.\n\n# Development\n## Testing\nTests are written with Jasmine flavor using Jest.\n\n## Docs\nThe docs are available as a static site in /docs\n\n## License\n(c) 2019-2020 - Daniel Thompson-Yvetot and contributors\n\nMIT\n","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-forage"},{"id":"github_tauri_apps_tauri_hotkey_rs","name":"tauri-hotkey-rs","description":null,"kind":"code","stars":10,"watchers":10,"subscribers":5,"openIssues":2,"forks":1,"defaultBranch":"dev","language":"Rust","topics":[],"isTemplate":false,"lastUpdated":"2022-04-25T05:01:07Z","createdAt":"2021-02-14T04:49:18Z","text":"# Tauri Hotkey\n\nThis crate provides cross platform APIs to register keyboard hotkeys.

However a recent\n  newcomer [`@ltd/j-toml`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ltd/j-toml) has\n  appeared with 0.5 support and astoundingly fast parsing speeds for large\n  text blocks. All I can say is you'll have to test your specific work loads\n  if you want to know which of @tauri-apps/toml and @ltd/j-toml is faster for\n  you, as we currently excell in different areas\n* Careful adherence to spec. Tests go beyond simple coverage.\n* Smallest parser bundle (if you use `@tauri-apps/toml/parse-string`).\n* No deps.\n* Detailed and easy to read error messages‼\n\n```console\n> TOML.parse(src)\nError: Unexpected character, expecting string, number, datetime, boolean, inline array or inline table at row 6, col 5, pos 87:\n5: \"abc\\\"\" = { abc=123,def=\"abc\" }\n6> foo=sdkfj\n       ^\n7:\n```\n\n## TOML.parse(str) → Object [(example)](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/examples/parse.js)\n\nAlso available with: `require('@tauri-apps/toml/parse-string')`\n\nSynchronously parse a TOML string and return an object.\n\n\n## TOML.stringify(obj) → String [(example)](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/examples/stringify.js)\n\nAlso available with: `require('@tauri-apps/toml/stringify)`\n\nSerialize an object as TOML.\n\n## [your-object].toJSON\n\nIf an object `TOML.stringify` is serializing has a `toJSON` method then it\nwill call it to transform the object before serializing it.  This matches\nthe behavior of `JSON.stringify`.\n\nThe one exception to this is that `toJSON` is not called for `Date` objects\nbecause `JSON` represents dates as strings and TOML can represent them natively.\n\n[`moment`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) objects are treated the\nsame as native `Date` objects, in this respect.\n\n## TOML.stringify.value(obj) -> String\n\nAlso available with: `require('@tauri-apps/toml/stringify').value`\n\nSerialize a value as TOML would.  This is a fragment and not a complete\nvalid TOML document.\n\n## Promises and Streaming\n\nThe parser provides alternative async and streaming interfaces, for times\nthat you're working with really absurdly big TOML files and don't want to\ntie-up the event loop while it parses.\n\n### TOML.parse.async(str[, opts]) → Promise(Object) [(example)](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/examples/parse-async.js)\n\nAlso available with: `require('@tauri-apps/toml/parse-async')`\n\n`opts.blocksize` is the amount text to parser per pass through the event loop. Defaults to 40kb.\n\nAsynchronously parse a TOML string and return a promise of the resulting object.\n\n### TOML.parse.stream(readable) → Promise(Object) [(example)](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/examples/parse-stream-readable.js)\n\nAlso available with: `require('@tauri-apps/toml/parse-stream')`\n\nGiven a readable stream, parse it as it feeds us data. Return a promise of the resulting object.\n\n### readable.pipe(TOML.parse.stream()) → Transform [(example)](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/examples/parse-stream-through.js)\n\nAlso available with: `require('@tauri-apps/toml/parse-stream')`\n\nReturns a transform stream in object mode.  When it completes, emit the\nresulting object. Only one object will ever be emitted.\n\n## Lowlevel Interface [(example)](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/examples/parse-lowlevel.js) [(example w/ parser debugging)](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/examples/parse-lowlevel-debug.js)\n\nYou construct a parser object, per TOML file you want to process:\n\n```js\nconst TOMLParser = require('@tauri-apps/toml/lib/toml-parser.js')\nconst parser = new TOMLParser()\n```\n\nThen you call the `parse` method for each chunk as you read them, or in a\nsingle call:\n\n```js\nparser.parse(`hello = 'world'`)\n```\n\nAnd finally, you call the `finish` method to complete parsing and retrieve\nthe resulting object.\n\n```js\nconst data = parser.finish()\n```\n\nBoth the `parse` method and `finish` method will throw if they find a\nproblem with the string they were given.  Error objects thrown from the\nparser have `pos`, `line` and `col` attributes.  `TOML.parse` adds a visual\nsummary of where in the source string there were issues using\n`parse-pretty-error` and you can too:\n\n```js\nconst prettyError = require('./parse-pretty-error.js')\nconst newErr = prettyError(err, sourceString)\n```\n\n## What's Different\n\nVersion 2 of this module supports TOML 0.5.0.  Other modules currently\npublished to the npm registry support 0.4.0.  0.5.0 is mostly backwards\ncompatible with 0.4.0, but if you have need, you can install @tauri-apps/toml@1\nto get a version of this module that supports 0.4.0.  Please see the\n[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md#2.0.0) for details on exactly whats changed.\n\n## TOML we can't do\n\n* `-nan` is a valid TOML value and is converted into `NaN`. There is no way to\n  produce `-nan` when stringifying. Stringification will produce positive `nan`.\n* Detecting and erroring on invalid utf8 documents: This is because Node's\n  UTF8 processing converts invalid sequences into the placeholder character\n  and does not have facilities for reporting these as errors instead.  We\n  _can_ detect the placeholder character, but it's valid to intentionally\n  include them in documents, so erroring on them is not great.\n* On versions of Node < 10, very large Integer values will lose precision.\n  On Node >=10, bigints are used.\n* Floating/local dates and times are still represented by JavaScript Date\n  objects, which don't actually support these concepts. The objects\n  returned have been modified so that you can determine what kind of thing\n  they are (with `isFloating`, `isDate`, `isTime` properties) and that\n  their ISO representation (via `toISOString`) is representative of their\n  TOML value.  They will correctly round trip if you pass them to\n  `TOML.stringify`.\n* Binary, hexadecimal and octal values are converted to ordinary integers and\n  will be decimal if you stringify them.\n\n## Changes\n\nI write a by hand, honest-to-god,\n[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/CHANGELOG.md)\nfor this project.  It's a description of what went into a release that you\nthe consumer of the module could care about, not a list of git commits, so\nplease check it out!\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nYou can run them yourself with:\n\n```console\n$ npm run benchmark\n```\n\nThe results below are from my laptop using Node 11.10.0.  The library\nversions tested were `@tauri-apps/toml@2.2.2`, `toml-j0.4@1.1.1`, `toml@3.0.0`,\n`@sgarciac/bombadil@2.1.0` and `@ltd/j-toml@0.5.47`.  The speed value is\nmegabytes-per-second that the parser can process of that document type.\nBigger is better. The percentage after average results is the margin of error.\n\nAs this table is getting a little wide, with how npm and github display it,\nyou can also view it seperately in the [BENCHMARK](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/BENCHMARK.html) document.\n\n|   | @tauri-apps/toml |   | toml-j0.4 |   | toml |   | @sgarciac/bombadil |   | @ltd/j-toml |   |\n| - | ----------- | - | --------- | - | ---- | - | ------------------ | - | ----------- | - |\n| Overall | 25MB/sec | 0.55% | 7MB/sec | 1.39% | 0.2MB/sec | 3.47% | - | - | 38MB/sec | 1.37% |\n| Spec Example: v0.4.0 | 23MB/sec | 0.87% | 10MB/sec | 0.62% | 1MB/sec | 1.89% | 1.7MB/sec | 1.03% | 35MB/sec | 1.32% |\n| Spec Example: Hard Unicode | 57MB/sec | 1.46% | 16MB/sec | 0.66% | 2MB/sec | 2.25% | 0.8MB/sec | 0.57% | 93MB/sec | 1.79% |\n| Types: Array, Inline | 7.2MB/sec | 1.60% | 3.2MB/sec | 0.77% | 0.1MB/sec | 1.84% | 1.7MB/sec | 0.56% | 4.1MB/sec | 14.48% |\n| Types: Array | 6.9MB/sec | 0.47% | 5.8MB/sec | 0.46% | 0.1MB/sec | 3.67% | 1.4MB/sec | 0.76% | 2.5MB/sec | 8.19% |\n| Types: Boolean, | 22MB/sec | 0.85% | 8.5MB/sec | 0.55% | 0.2MB/sec | 1.83% | 2.1MB/sec | 1.29% | 5.6MB/sec | 0.58% |\n| Types: Datetime | 18MB/sec | 0.56% | 11MB/sec | 0.80% | 0.3MB/sec | 1.55% | 0.8MB/sec | 0.51% | 4.5MB/sec | 0.66% |\n| Types: Float | 9.2MB/sec | 0.71% | 5.2MB/sec | 1.12% | 0.3MB/sec | 2.04% | 2.6MB/sec | 0.86% | 3.7MB/sec | 0.61% |\n| Types: Int | 6.4MB/sec | 0.44% | 3.9MB/sec | 0.56% | 0.1MB/sec | 1.65% | 1.7MB/sec | 1.15% | 1.5MB/sec | 4.06% |\n| Types: Literal String, 7 char | 26MB/sec | 0.62% | 8.1MB/sec | 1.00% | 0.3MB/sec | 1.48% | 2.9MB/sec | 0.58% | 6MB/sec | 0.52% |\n| Types: Literal String, 92 char | 41MB/sec | 0.80% | 11MB/sec | 1.20% | 0.4MB/sec | 2.38% | 15MB/sec | 0.84% | 23MB/sec | 0.58% |\n| Types: Literal String, Multiline, 1079 char | 21MB/sec | 0.28% | 7.2MB/sec | 1.62% | 1.3MB/sec | 3.05% | 55MB/sec | 0.53% | 332MB/sec | 0.46% |\n| Types: Basic String, 7 char | 26MB/sec | 0.56% | 6.6MB/sec | 0.61% | 0.2MB/sec | 4.70% | 2.7MB/sec | 0.68% | 3.3MB/sec | 0.47% |\n| Types: Basic String, 92 char | 41MB/sec | 0.63% | 8MB/sec | 0.51% | 0.1MB/sec | 1.57% | 14MB/sec | 0.66% | 21MB/sec | 0.43% |\n| Types: Basic String, 1079 char | 21MB/sec | 0.36% | 6MB/sec | 0.81% | 0.1MB/sec | 1.81% | 51MB/sec | 0.53% | 13MB/sec | 0.62% |\n| Types: Table, Inline | 9.8MB/sec | 0.47% | 4.6MB/sec | 0.81% | 0.1MB/sec | 1.82% | 1.7MB/sec | 0.75% | 2.9MB/sec | 4.82% |\n| Types: Table | 6.9MB/sec | 0.43% | 4.9MB/sec | 0.46% | 0.1MB/sec | 3.59% | 1.6MB/sec | 0.88% | 4.4MB/sec | 0.53% |\n| Scaling: Array, Inline, 1000 elements | 33MB/sec | 2.15% | 2.5MB/sec | 1.07% | 0.1MB/sec | 3.57% | 1.8MB/sec | 0.64% | 8.7MB/sec | 4.12% |\n| Scaling: Array, Nested, 1000 deep | 1.6MB/sec | 2.50% | 1.2MB/sec | 0.49% | 0.1MB/sec | 3.62% | - | - | 1MB/sec | 3.79% |\n| Scaling: Literal String, 40kb | 56MB/sec | 0.58% | 12MB/sec | 1.03% | 3.6MB/sec | 4.00% | 17MB/sec | 0.54% | 498MB/sec | 0.52% |\n| Scaling: Literal String, Multiline, 40kb | 58MB/sec | 0.38% | 6.4MB/sec | 0.54% | 0.2MB/sec | 1.72% | 15MB/sec | 0.74% | 197MB/sec | 0.54% |\n| Scaling: Basic String, Multiline, 40kb | 57MB/sec | 1.03% | 7.2MB/sec | 1.22% | 3.4MB/sec | 4.24% | 15MB/sec | 0.75% | 840MB/sec | 0.52% |\n| Scaling: Basic String, 40kb | 57MB/sec | 0.43% | 8.6MB/sec | 0.57% | 0.2MB/sec | 1.71% | 17MB/sec | 0.51% | 394MB/sec | 0.54% |\n| Scaling: Table, Inline, 1000 elements | 27MB/sec | 0.46% | 7.5MB/sec | 0.71% | 0.3MB/sec | 2.24% | 3MB/sec | 0.74% | 2.3MB/sec | 0.81% |\n| Scaling: Table, Inline, Nested, 1000 deep | 7.8MB/sec | 0.61% | 4.3MB/sec | 0.83% | 0.1MB/sec | 2.93% | - | - | 1.2MB/sec | 13.45% |\n\n## Tests\n\nThe test suite is maintained at 100% coverage: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/iarna/iarna-toml/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/iarna/iarna-toml)\n\nThe spec was carefully hand converted into a series of test framework\nindependent (and mostly language independent) assertions, as pairs of TOML\nand YAML files.  You can find those files here:\n[spec-test](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/spec-test/).\nA number of examples of invalid Unicode were also written, but are difficult\nto make use of in Node.js where Unicode errors are silently hidden.  You can\nfind those here: [spec-test-disabled](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/spec-test-disabled/).\n\nFurther tests were written to increase coverage to 100%, these may be more\nimplementation specific, but they can be found in [coverage](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/coverage.js) and\n[coverage-error](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/coverage-error.js).\n\nI've also written some quality assurance style tests, which don't contribute\nto coverage but do cover scenarios that could easily be problematic for some\nimplementations can be found in:\n[test/qa.js](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/qa.js) and\n[test/qa-error.js](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/qa-error.js).\n\nAll of the official example files from the TOML spec are run through this\nparser and compared to the official YAML files when available. These files are from the TOML spec as of:\n[357a4ba6](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/tree/357a4ba6782e48ff26e646780bab11c90ed0a7bc)\nand specifically are:\n\n* [github.com/toml-lang/toml/tree/357a4ba6/examples](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/tree/357a4ba6782e48ff26e646780bab11c90ed0a7bc/examples)\n* [github.com/toml-lang/toml/tree/357a4ba6/tests](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/tree/357a4ba6782e48ff26e646780bab11c90ed0a7bc/tests)\n\nThe stringifier is tested by round-tripping these same files, asserting that\n`TOML.parse(sourcefile)` deepEqual\n`TOML.parse(TOML.stringify(TOML.parse(sourcefile))`.  This is done in\n[test/roundtrip-examples.js](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/round-tripping.js)\nThere are also some tests written to complete coverage from stringification in:\n[test/stringify.js](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/stringify.js)\n\nTests for the async and streaming interfaces are in [test/async.js](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/async.js) and [test/stream.js](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/stream.js) respectively.\n\nTests for the parsers debugging mode live in [test/devel.js](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/devel.js).\n\nAnd finally, many more stringification tests were borrowed from [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23)'s\n[toml-stream](https://npmjs.com/package/toml-stream) module. They were fetched as of\n[b6f1e26b572d49742d49fa6a6d11524d003441fa](https://github.com/othiym23/toml-stream/tree/b6f1e26b572d49742d49fa6a6d11524d003441fa/test) and live in\n[test/toml-stream](https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/blob/latest/test/toml-stream/).\n\n## Improvements to make\n\n* In stringify:\n  * Any way to produce comments.  As a JSON stand-in I'm not too worried\n    about this.  That said, a document orientated fork is something I'd like\n    to look at eventually…\n  * Stringification could use some work on its error reporting.  It reports\n    _what's_ wrong, but not where in your data structure it was.\n* Further optimize the parser:\n  * There are some debugging assertions left in the main parser, these should be moved to a subclass.\n  * Make the whole debugging parser thing work as a mixin instead of as a superclass.\n","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-toml"},{"id":"github_tauri_apps_realworld","name":"realworld","description":"Realworld apps made with Tauri: Proof of Agnosis.","kind":"unknown","stars":4,"watchers":4,"subscribers":5,"openIssues":1,"forks":0,"defaultBranch":"dev","language":"JavaScript","topics":[],"isTemplate":false,"lastUpdated":"2021-03-02T14:54:39Z","createdAt":"2020-02-05T22:02:37Z","license":"MIT License","text":"# Tauri x Realworld apps\n\nThis project is an experiment to demonstrate how easy you can bundle an existing frontend app with Tauri, whichever the framework you're using, without having to change a single line from the codebase.\n\nThe main script (build.js) simply consists in a pipeline that will clone, install dependencies, build the application, initialize Tauri then bundle the application. \n\n## Setup\n\n1.
