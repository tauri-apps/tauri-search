# AST Folder

A place where _generated_ content will be placed. This includes:

- **AST info**: this acts as a sort of "cache" of what was used to build the current index
- **Sitemap**: a JSON file indicating the sitemap of Markdown documents ... this is done on a per repo, per branch manner where files are `sitemap-[repo]-[branch]`
